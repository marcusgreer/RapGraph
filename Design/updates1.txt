As stated in the time sheet, “A lot of progress was made in making the Data Scraper for AZLyrics.com in this time. By 7:30 I had a working web scraper that could gather the lyrics from an artist’s whole discography, however by 8:00 I was banned from the website. I spent the next half an hour waiting for the website to go back up because I had thought that it had just gone down. I emailed AZLyrics the next day, and only then did I find out that I had been banned.” Because of certain complications with web scrapers, websites and calculus exams progress in this past week was slightly hampered. However, with the web scraper and twitter APIs finally working, I feel like I am over the learning curve with the majority of the work and most of what is left (save the tag graph) is some permutation of what we have already learned in class. I am optimistic that the project will grow by leaps and bounds in the next week.
