By 7:30 I had a working web scraper that could gather the lyrics from an artistÕs whole discography, however by 8:00 I was banned from the website. I spent the next half an hour waiting for the website to go back up because I had thought that it had just gone down. I emailed AZLyrics the next day, and only then did I find out that I had been banned.Monday 4/20:4:30 - 7:00 I worked on the web scraper for Lyrics.com but found that it did not have enough data, so I had to once again make a new data Scraper for MetaLyrics.com.
