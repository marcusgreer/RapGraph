order to protect itself from this mad citywhile consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to surviveone thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterflythe butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillarbut having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weakand figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefitsalready surrounded by this mad citythe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes himhe can no longer see past his own thoughtshes trappedwhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take rootssuch as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad citythe resultwings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnantfinally free

warehouse tied to a chairwith an abundance of flair surrounding me in a circular angleglared up at the dragon queens lair wasnt imagining a thingher steps on the stairs had a magic gleam glowed brightlyto prepare me for my journey a sword was hovering towards meplus garlic from the keepers of the gate who bore all the secrets and takecare of trespassers but at last its prophesied that i would gainaccess to a cultural dynasty buried and seize and capture the scrollmassive helicopters patrolled the rooftops strapped inbegan traveling into the darkness knew not of what awaitedi thought

then i pulled the sword and somehowit affected all the creatures as they stepped back and bowedand the same glow that i seen in the sword i seen in the eyes of the lionwho began leading me in a specific directionas if trying to tell me somethingjust over the horizon the same creatures who had been describedappeared in statue form but their eyes scopedand as i approached the gate they began to break open and criedafter years we have finally been awakenedthe assault was on i got knocked to the ground by oneshocked in an unorthodox form boxingthrowing an abnormal proportion of body blows karate chopsand drop kicks plunged struggling deeper into the swampthen i grabbed my sword the garlic put it around my necksaw that it was draining all of their energy and then with a swingoff with their headsthe gates slowly and mysteriously openedso curiously i moseyed in with intensity focusing on my objectivespider webs the size of kingsize bedsfell into a secret passage not knowing to where it leadjust then the same light beamed brightly and in the distanceat that instance lo and behold the hidden scrolland just as i thought my mission was overi could feel the dragon queen breathing heavily over my shoulderas she began to transform and metamorphosisshe took on an assortment of legs arms heads and eyesand sprouted two horns and began to breathe fireso once again i grabbed my trusty sword but to my astonishmentshe burned it to a crisp turned and grasped the scrolland exited much faster than secreted gas im gaspingclasp full of flames cast in my directioni saw my whole life

me i am what i am everything i wanna bechorusbridgeoutro this is on a bus back from camp im thirteen and so are you before i left for camp i imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes i hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble it turned out it would be me and just one girl thats you and were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us were still wearing our orange camp tshirts we still smell like pineneedles i like you and you like me and i morethanlike you but i dont know if you do or dont morethanlike me youve never said so i havent been saying anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on a girl whos smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be a girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wetback in the real world we dont go to the same school and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood we wont go to the same high school so this is kind of it for us unless i say something and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something the suns gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know and then im like can i tell you something and all of a sudden im telling you and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway and theres no expression on it and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny i dont remember in what context doesnt really matter before long im out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay i dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment but theres nowhere to go because were are on a bus so i pretend like im asleep and before long i really ami wake up the bus isnt moving anymore the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on i turn and youre not there then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore were parked at the pickup point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church the bus is half empty you might be in your dads car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row it used to be our row on our way off its michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head adolescence is doing her a ton of favors bodywise she stops and looks down at me and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i cant really see her face but i can see her smile and she says one word destiny then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus i didnt know you were friends with themi find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over so is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts this isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad this is a story about how i learned something and im not saying this thing is true or not im just saying its what i learned i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always everybody cant turn around

and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny end quotewhen he runs out of things to say to this girl he falls asleep and wakes up at the pickup point where all the parents are collecting their kids as he gets off the bus the girls from the back of the bus run into the boy and mock him for what he said to the girl who hed spent the bus ride home talking to he expresses that he didnt know the girl was friends with these other girls because it appears as though when the boy was asleep the girl he was talking to decide to share what he told herthe boy states that he learned to cut out the middle man all the time and just tell everyone because theyre going to find out somehow anyway maybe this is maybe why were getting such a personal album from donald in because the internet because he is cutting out the middle man and just expressing his feelings and emotions through is music the boy finishesquote that power i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit but thats
